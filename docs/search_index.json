["rmarkdown.html", "8 R Markdown", " 8 R Markdown For this class read ch.27 (“R Markdown”) from R for Data Science - http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html The traditional approach for statistical data analysis is to analyse the data and write up the results separatey. For example, you may conduct your analysis in R and then copy the output to Word and write up your results there. This is an error prone approach. The code and the results are not synchronisd so that if you change your code the results will not change automatically. You can also make mistake when copying the results. R Markdown was designed to combine statistical analysis and communication into a single framework. The code and the results are combined in a single document, and you can also add text, external tables and images if you want. You can use R Markdown to produce documents in different formats (html, Word, pdf, presentation slides). This website has been produced using R Markdown. There are many places on the web where you can learn the basics of R Markdown and there is no point for me to repeat them here. Please see ch.27 from R for Data Science (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) and the official R Markdown website (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and follow the links. You can also check this webpage: https://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html (this is part of a course at the University of British Columbia that is similar to our module, but somewhat more advanced). Here I will focus on a few things that are specifically relevant for your reports. You can knit your reports in either pdf or Word formats. If you are going to use Word you will noy be able to use the stargazer package for regression output. You may try to use a combination of the packages memisc and pander to achieve the same result (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24342162/regression-tables-in-markdown-format-for-flexible-use-in-r-markdown-v2), but I haven’t tried this and I cannot guarantee that it will work. Also see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html If you want to knit as pdf you will need to install LaTeX first (https://www.latex-project.org). Install LaTeX (complete version), restart your computer, restart R Studio and it should all work automatically. If you knit as pdf with LaTeX stargazer will work just fine, but you need to set the results argument to ‘asis’ and run the stargazer in a separate R chunk. The code will look something like ```{r results = 'asis'} stargazer(m1, m2, m3, m4, type = \"latex\") ``` You need to include all your code in your report. You do not need to include messages and warnings. You may also want to use cache to speed up the rendering of your document. To achieve this result include in the beginning of your R Mardown file an R chunk setting the following global options. ```{r setup} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE) knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE) knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE) ``` If you experience problems with caching switch it to FALSE. To knit a document you can use a button in R Studio. In my experience, sometimes it does not work as intended. Then you can use the command line: rmarkdown::render(&quot;your_file.Rmd&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown::word_document&quot;) rmarkdown::render(&quot;your_file.Rmd&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown::pdf_document&quot;) You will want to include a bibliography in your report. An easy way to do this is simply to type it in the end of your document. "]
